# Alyssa Alexander 
### Welcome to my Bio 

Howdy! My name is Alyssa Alexander, and here's some information about me: 

I'm Business major with a Technology Management and French minor. I have moved around growing up and graduated from high school overseas. 
I will be graduating in May and joining the workforce, potentially with Amazon!
I am involved with various organizations on campus, two of which is Maggies and Camp Kesem and work as a research assistant for Dr. Mendoza. 
I come from a long line of Aggies, both my brother graduated in 2018 and my sister did in 2019, but is now attending a grad program at Mays. 


Thanks for reading!
